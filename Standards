The average power consumption of a laptop's CPU, disk, and memory can vary significantly based on the specific hardware, usage patterns, and power management settings. However,below are some general estimates:

CPU Power Consumption:

Average: Around 15-45 watts for normal usage.
Idle: Around 5-10 watts.
High load: Can peak at 45 watts or more, depending on the CPU model and workload.
Disk Power Consumption:

HDD (Hard Disk Drive):
Average: Around 2-6 watts.
Idle: Around 0.5-2 watts.
SSD (Solid State Drive):
Average: Around 1-3 watts.
Idle: Less than 1 watt.
Memory (RAM) Power Consumption:

Average: Around 2-5 watts per 8GB module.
High load: Can peak at 5 watts or more per module.
Combined Estimate per Minute:
For an average laptop under typical usage conditions:

CPU: Let's take an average of 30 watts.
Disk: Assuming an SSD, let's take an average of 2 watts.
Memory: Assuming 16GB of RAM (2 x 8GB modules), let's take an average of 6 watts.
Total power consumption per minute:
Total power consumption = CPU + Disk + Memory
Total power consumption = 30 watts + 2 watts + 6 watts = 38 watts

So, an average laptop's combined CPU, disk, and memory power consumption per minute is around 38 watts.

Adjusting for Specific Laptops:
You can adjust these numbers based on your laptop's specific components and usage patterns. High-performance laptops or those under heavy load may have higher power consumption, while ultrabooks or energy-efficient models may have lower consumption.
