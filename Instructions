To run this code, you need to ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed on your system. Follow these steps:

Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from python.org.

Install Required Libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries using pip:

pip install psutil
pip install tk

Save the Code: Save the provided code into a Python file, e.g., telemetry_collector.py.

Run the Script: In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the telemetry_collector.py file and run the script using Python:

python telemetry_collector.py

Using the GUI: A GUI window will open with a button labeled "Run Telemetry". Click the button to start collecting telemetry data for 60 seconds. The telemetry collection process will display the remaining time and collect CPU, disk I/O, and memory usage data.

Viewing Results: After the collection period, a new window will display the average values for CPU percent, disk I/O (in GB), memory percent, and estimated power consumption. It will also provide optimization suggestions based on the collected data.

Make sure to close any unnecessary applications to observe more accurate telemetry data for the current system usage.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
